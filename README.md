Morphoo
=======

Morphoo is a Java object transformation library. The name is based from the greek work 'metamorphoo' which means
to transform. It aims to decouple your java classes from the way they can be transformed into other classes while
at the same time offering a single consistent interface to perform said transformations.

Getting Started
---------------

At the present time, we are trying to get Morphoo into the Maven Central repository. In the meanwhile, you can download
the latest jar file to use in your java project.
